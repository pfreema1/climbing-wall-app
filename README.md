A web app for the climbers of High Point Riverside. Allows users to create and upload problems for the training wall.

Remembering all of the routes I made up for training was starting to become difficult, so I decided to make it easier! 

I used this app as an opportunity to sharpen my Vanilla JS skills, and to dip my toes into working with a database using PHP/MySql.
